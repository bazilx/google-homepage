# google-homepage
Welcome to the google readme file. In this file I will log the skills learned and utilized in copying the html and css from the google homepage.

As I have now completed this assignment(easy method) I can say the most beneficial elements are the development of the HTML code, positioning of the elements/styling using css. In addition using git to track and commit changes to my personal github account from the terminal was helpful.
